                <h3>Big Data Infrastructure, <u>Hadoop</u>- tools and technologies for storage, Processing</h3>
                
                <p><b>Hadoop</b> is a <u>open-source framework</u> for <u>distributed storage</u> (on commodity clusters) and for processing the huge volume 
                    (>PBs, that traditional database systems can't handle) of <u>heterogeneous</u> (structured, semistructured and unstructured)
                     type of data. Hadoop is very <u>scalable</u>- capability to sustain performace even under highly increasing loads by adding
                     more cluster nodes and <u>cost-effective</u>- low cost commodity hardware. Hadoop doesn't require reliable and expensive
                    hardware. Hadoop files are written once and read many (WORM) times. The content of files can't be changed. <br>
                    Created by <b>Doug Cutting</b> and Mike <b>Cafarella</b> in <b>University of Washington.</b><br>
                    <h4>The core components of Hadoop are:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <b><li>HDFS</li>
                            <li>Hadoop Common</li>
                            <li>MapReduce</li></b>
                    </ul>
                    <b>HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)</b> designed to store huge volume of data in distributed manner of commodity clusters. <br>
                    <b>Hadoop Common</b> is a core module of Hadoop collection of common essential utilities which supports other Hadoop modules. <br>
                    <b>MapReduce</b> batch processing programming framework for the Hadoop, which uses divide and conquer strategy by combining 
                    computational power near to data where it is stored (clusters). It is highly reliable, fault-tolerant and capable of processing any format 
                    of data. In Hadoop 1.0 MapReduce was the only distributed processing framework.<br>
                    
                    <h4>Other components of Hadoop are:</h4>
                    <b>YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)</b> is another distributed processing framework introduces in Hadoop 2.0. It overcomes
                    some limitations of MapReduce.

                <h3>Classification</h3>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>Extracts models (called classifiers) describing important data classes(discrete, unordered and categorical or nominal)</li>
                        <li>Supervised learning (output or class lables are also present with features)</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Two Steps of Classification</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Learning Step= Training + Testing:</b>Construct classification model based on previous data and test Performance Metrics on both training 
                        data and test data.</li>
                    <li><b>Classification Step:</b> If model is good enough (depends on situation), Use to predict/classify the classes of unseen data.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Classifiers can be represented by <u>Classification rules, decision trees or mathematical formulae.</u></p>
                <h3>Learning Step</h3>
                <p>Roughly we divide the data set into two parts: <u>training set and test set.</u> We use training set to train/construct our model
                and test set to assess our model based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall F1-score etc.</p>
                 <h3>Decision Tree Induction- learning of decision tree</h3> 
                 <p>A decision tree is a tree like (hierarchical) structure in which an internal node represents a test and the branch associated with node represents an outcome of
                    the test and leaf nodes represent classes.

                 </p>
                 <h4>How to construct decision tree?</h4>
                 <h5>Some concepts from Information Theory.</h5>
                 <p><b>Information:</b> Reduction in Uncertainty. When we get some information the contextual uncertainty is reduced. <br>
                 <b>Entropy:</b>Measure of Randomness or Uncertainty in data. There are various measures of entropy, for example Shannon's Entropy, Gini Index.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Idea behind Construction of Decision Tree</h3>
                    <p> As we go from root node to leaf node We should proceed from Uncertainty to Certainty and as soon as possible (least possible height of decision tree). So select 
                        the first attribute to be tested such that resulting partitions of data are as pure/homogeneous as possible. A partition is pure is all tuples belong
                        to same class.<b>The difference between uncertainty of the data set and sum of the uncertainty of all partitions based on some attribute
                        is maximum.</b> Then that attribute should be tested first- this will reduce the height of decision tree. This is called <b>Attribute Selection.</b>
                        There are various attribute selection measure- information gain, gain ratio and Gini Index. Decision tree induction is based on <b>heuristic search approach-</b>
                         in which guiding factors are various attribute selection measures. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Three decision tree Induction Algorithms</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser)</b></li><p>Developed by J. Ross Quinlan in early 1980s. <br>
                            Uses Information Gain as  attribute selection measure.</p>
                        <li><b>C4.5 (Successer of ID3)</b></li><p>Developed by J. Ross Quinlan <br>
                        Uses Information Ratio as attribute selection measure.</p>
                        <li><b>CART (Classification and regression Trees)</b></li><p>Developed by a group of Statisticians (L. Breiman, J. Friedman, R. Olshen, C. Stone) <br>
                        Uses Gini Index as attribute selection measure.</p>
                    </ol>
                    <p>All the above adopt a <u>greedy (i.e., non-backtracking) divide and conquer top-down appoach</u> to construct decision tree.</p>

                    <h4><b>Information Gain</b></h4>
                    <p><b>Classification Setting:</b> Suppose a dataset D with n attributes (A<sub>i</sub>'s; i=1,2,...,n) and there are m classes (C<sub>i</sub>'s; i=1,2,...,m).
                    p<sub>i</sub>'s are proportions of each class. p<sub>i</sub>=|C<sub>i,D</sub>|/|D|.</p>
                    <p>Information Gain is defined as differece between the original information requirement (i.e., based on just proportion of classes) and the
                         new requirement (i.e., obtained after partitioning on attribute A)</p>
                         <p>Expected Information need to classify a tuple in D, <br>
                        <b>Info(D)= &Sigma;<sub>i=1</sub> <sup>m</sup> p<sub>i</sub>*log(<sub>i</sub>)</b></p>
